# recursion-by-refactoring

_A step-by-step approach to recursion by refactoring from obvious but limited code to a clean recursive version._

I have long believed that the most "complicated" thing about recursion is the explanations offered when it is taught poorly. This represents my attempt to help in that regard. The project takes a couple of basic tasks and incrementally refactors their solutions into recursive form, attempting to make each step as painless as possible.

The project uses Node.js because it is widely used and readily available. No value judgment is expressed or implied about the merits or demerits of JavaScript versus any other language.

## Status

This is a work in process; the next step after initial set up will be documentation of the problems being addressed, the strategies for refactoring, and the thought patterns that are applied.

## Title

Yes, the title is dry and boring. I thought about calling it "Recursing without cursing", but am still kicking around alternatives. I am not in marketing.

### Double-crossing and obstacle

An obstacle lies between you and your goal. This is bad. Sometimes the quickest solution is to _double-cross_ the obstacle, as illustrated below.

You're walking along the bank of the river toward the goal, and an obstacle comes into view. Maybe it's a steep gully, or quicksand, or a briar patch, or a moat filled with sharks with laser beams strapped to their heads. But the opposite bank of the river offers smooth, easy walking. So...

* Cross to the opposite bank;
* Walk on that side until near the goal; and then
* Cross back to the original side to reach the goal.

That's why I called it a "double-cross". But what does that look like in practice?

Stay tuned for the next update to these notes!
